## Info

### the recitation audio

This is a **bhikkhupātimokkhapāḷi** recitation in 2015 (slow speed version) by *Venerable Sayadaw U Kovida* (Myanmar).

For learning purposes, the recording was later divided into 07 files for 07 days (Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday). (I have received these files from *Ven. U Kāruṇika*.)

### the e-book

The Roman pāḷi text is from [this VRI version](https://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/vin04t.nrf0.xml).

Pāḷi syllable splitting lines are generated using this [palieasyread](https://github.com/vpnry/palieasyread).


> **Note**: The syllable spliting lines may not be 100% perfect, but it can be helpful for beginners to follow along the chanting audio by the Sayadaw.
> 
> *When you are pretty familiar with the pronunciation and rhythm, it is better to use the normal writing words directly*.
